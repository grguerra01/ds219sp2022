Title: Contributing to open source for the first time
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6b6B9oN4Vg

The video is made by an employee of Facebook detailing their recommendations for
getting started working on open-source, and has a working demonstration where they
make some changes to the GitHub repository for Pytorch. The guide is detailed and step
by step as we follow along as they look at the tech docs, contribution guide, and all
relevant information first-time contributors should be made aware of before getting
started.

I think I learned the most from this video by watching their step-by-step breakdown
of the process and how they approached making a contribution to an open source project.

I probably would not recommend this video, as even though it is detailed enough and
made by a large and familiar company, 18 minutes is pretty long and I'm sure there
are some community-made guides out there that are more concise.
