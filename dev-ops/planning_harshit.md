## SLACK


### What is Slack?
Slack is the collaboration hub that brings the right people, information, and tools together to get work done, 
even when you can’t all be in the same room at the same time. It’s a tool that you can 
use on your computer and your phone to stay in touch with your team, and keep everyone up to date with 
the important news and goings-on.

### Why use Slack?
Slack is like a chatroom for your whole team. It is a computer application that was created as a way for organizations
to communicate both as a group and in personal one-on-one discussions. 
You can communicate as a group through channels or privately via “direct messaging.” 
It is an awesome tool to help you organize! Slack makes communicating easy and fun.


### Is Slack the right tool for my team?
Slack can replace email, text messaging, and instant messaging for your team, and keep all those communication 
styles together in one app. But no app is going to be totally magic. Slack might work for your team’s work style, 
and it might not. And as with everything, there is security to consider. 
But if you take the time to set up your team’s Slack workspace, and you purposefully manage it (as you would any other tech tool), 
it can provide a great sense of community for your team, no matter when or where they’re working.

#### Pros
1. Share documents and files with some or all of your teammates (written, image, video)
2. You can @ mention teammates, which can send them a push notification on their phone or computer — a great way to get their attention.
3. Stop losing things in email
4. Start a video or voice conference call with other members of the Slack team on the fly
5. Set reminders for yourself or others
6. particularly good for: real-time collaboration, quick questions and decisions, quick poll/quiz
7. Integrate 1000s of Apps to your slack workspace from App Store

#### Cons
1. Adoption: “not yet another app to install!”
2. Technology hurdles: if members of your team don’t have a smartphone, they won’t be able to use Slack when away from their computers.
3. Slack is less ideal for: major decision-making discussions, collaboration on large-scale projects
