Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery are two practices frequently used in 
modern developmental practices and DevOps. There is one main difference between
Continuous Deployment and Continuous Delivery, being the amount of human intervention
involved in the release process. For continuous delivery, any change made to the
program can be released at any time by the press of a button, allowing you to decide
when you want your changes to be released to your customers. However, for continuous
deployment, any change made to the code is instantly pushed to your customers, unless
an error is encountered, removing the need for a "release day".
