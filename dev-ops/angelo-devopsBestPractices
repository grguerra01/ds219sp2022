1. Agile Project Development
  Agile is an approach to project development/management that focuses on iterative, gradual deployment. Agile teams follow a continuous cycle that breaks
  large projects into small segments that are worked on one at a time. Usually the teams will develop throughout a "sprint" and come together regularly to 
  review their requirements/plans and ensure their work is sticking to the guidelines set in the planning phase. The product is then released at its current
  state and the next, slightly bigger version is started on.
 
2. Implement Automation
  Automation saves a lot of time in the testing and verification process. End-to-end testing, unit tests, and performance tests facilitate continuous
  integration and allow teammates to quickly merge into the main repo.

3. Observability
  It is vital to know exactly how your system is doing at any one time and predict how it will do in other circumstances. This becomes much more complex 
  with microservices, but logs, traces, and metrics make up the foundation of good observability. Logs give you time-series data about the app's functioning
  and are usually supplied by system components. Traces track the flow of logic throughout your system. Metrics include the tracking of CPU/GPU usage, disk 
  space, and network connectivity.
