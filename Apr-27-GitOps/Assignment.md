```
Kustomize and Kafka are common tools for cloud-native & data processing applications.
In the next class I've invited engineers whose focus is AI, Maching Learning, and Data Science.
They'll give a rundown of what to expect working in this area, what tools and pipelines are used,
and they'll answer any questions you have. 

Submit a PR to this folder after you complete these. Did you learn anything? Have you used Kafka before?
