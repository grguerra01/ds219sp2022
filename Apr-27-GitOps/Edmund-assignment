Before this lesson, I have only heard of Apache Kafka by name through a data engineering internship that I had. I knew that it was used in the pipeline side of data management, but never knew how it was actually used and how it interacted with Kubernetes. From working on the assignment, I see that the use of event-driven software such as this helps in scaling and throughput, as well as reduction in latency.
