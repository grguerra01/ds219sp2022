In order to begin contributing for Kubernetes, you first need to sign an agreement 
and know the basics of the documentation and their process for opening pull requests 
and reviewing changes. After that, you can go to their GitHub and open a pull request.
From there you can file issues to GitHub or begin working on pull requests. It is 
important to make your comments according to their content and style guides so your 
comments are informed. As well, Kubernetes has SIG Docs, a group of contributers who 
pulish and maintain Kubernetes documentation and the website. It is a great way for 
contributors to have a large impact on the Kubernetes project.
