## _How to Contribute to Mozilla Projects_

Mozilla Firefox, as we all know, is an open-source browser widely used by millions of users, developers, and cybersecurity experts. The software is free to use, and its source code is available to the public. Anyone, all around the world, can make changes to the software and fix bugs. 

## For Help

At times we may find it challenging before we start contributing or getting set up to work on Firefox and finding a bug that’s a good fit for our skills, bit Mozilla is always looking for ways to improve this process: making Mozilla more open, accessible, and easier to participate with. If we have any trouble following there official documentation, or hit a barrier we can’t get around, we can join them in the Introduction room on Matrix or contact Mike Hoye directly at mhoye@mozilla.com.
